# PetClinic REST API - .NET Version

A REST API for managing a veterinary clinic, built with ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core. This is a .NET implementation based on the [Spring PetClinic REST](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-rest) project.

## Features

- **Owners Management**: Create, read, update, and delete pet owners
- **Pets Management**: Manage pets with associated owners and pet types
- **Veterinarians**: Manage veterinarians and their specialties
- **Visits**: Schedule and track veterinary visits
- **Pet Types**: Manage pet type categories (Dog, Cat, etc.)
- **Specialties**: Manage veterinarian specialties (Surgery, Radiology, etc.)
- **Auto-generated API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI UI included
- **Sample Data**: Database is pre-populated with sample data on first run

## Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- SQLite (included with .NET)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/petclinic-rest.git
cd petclinic-rest
```

### 2. Build the Project

```bash
dotnet build
```

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
dotnet run
```

The application will start on `https://localhost:5001` (or `http://localhost:5000` for development).

### 4. Access the API

- **Swagger UI**: [https://localhost:5001/swagger/index.html](https://localhost:5001/swagger/index.html)
- **API Base URL**: `https://localhost:5001/api`

## Database

The application uses SQLite by default for simplicity. The database is automatically created and pre-populated with sample data on the first run.

### Switching to Another Database

To use SQL Server or another database provider:

1. Install the appropriate NuGet package:
   ```bash
   dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
   ```

2. Update `Program.cs`:
   ```csharp
   builder.Services.AddDbContext<PetClinicDbContext>(options =>
       options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));
   ```

3. Update the connection string in `appsettings.json`:
   ```json
   "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "Server=your-server;Database=petclinic;User Id=sa;Password=your-password;"
   }
   ```

## Sample Data

The database is pre-populated with sample data including:
- 5 Pet Types (Dog, Cat, Hamster, Rabbit, Bird)
- 3 Specialties (Radiology, Surgery, Dentistry)
- 5 Veterinarians
- 10 Pet Owners
- 10 Pets
- 3 Sample Visits

## Development

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
dotnet watch run
```

This will automatically rebuild and restart the application when code changes are detected.

### Building for Production

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release
```

### Running Tests

From the test project folder `tests/unit/PetClinicRest.Tests` run the following to add recommended packages:

```bash
cd tests/unit/PetClinicRest.Tests
dotnet add package xunit
dotnet add package xunit.runner.visualstudio
dotnet add package FluentAssertions
dotnet add package Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk
```

Then from the repository root restore and run the tests:

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet test tests/unit/PetClinicRest.Tests/PetClinicRest.Tests.csproj
```

These steps will install the testing dependencies and execute the test project.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error like:

```
Unhandled exception. System.IO.FileLoadException:
Could not load file or assembly
'/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.305/vstest.console.dll'.
Access is denied.

error MSB6006: "dotnet" exited with code 134
```

it is often caused by incorrect ownership or permissions on the system .NET SDK directory. Fix this by running:

```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/share/dotnet
sudo chmod -R u+rwX /usr/local/share/dotnet
```

Then retry running the tests:

```bash
dotnet test tests/unit/PetClinicRest.Tests/PetClinicRest.Tests.csproj
```
